(* A Mathematica model of the superparametric element,
   for the purpose of testing the integration routines. *)

(* Quadrilateral version assumes a basic square from (0,0)
   to (1,1), with the top center node, usually at (0.5,1), moved
   off to (0.5,1.1), so that the actual upper surface of the 
   node is parabolic. Note that, unlike in the triangular case,
   this element does not "almost" live in the master space,
   but instead spans (0,0) to (1,1).  This way, odd-order
   polynomials don't automatically give zero.


sfuns[x_,y_]:={ (-1/4)*(1-x)*(1-y)*(x+y+1), (1/2)*(1-x^2)*(1-y), 
                (1/4)*(1+x)*(1-y)*(x-y-1),  (1/2)*(1+x)*(1-y^2),
                (1/4)*(1+x)*(1+y)*(x+y-1),  (1/2)*(1-x^2)*(1+y),
                (1/4)*(1-x)*(1+y)*(y-x-1),  (1/2)*(1-x)*(1-y^2)   }

(* Change the coordinates to reflect what's really happening. *)

coords:={ { 0, 0}, { 1/2, 0}, {1 , 0}, {1, 1/2}, {1, 1}, {1/2, 9/10},
           {0, 1}, {0, 1/2}  }

fromMaster[x_,y_]:={ Sum[ coords[[i]][[1]]*sfuns[x,y][[i]], {i,1,8} ],
                       Sum[ coords[[i]][[2]]*sfuns[x,y][[i]], {i,1,8}] }



(* For this special case, the area integral within the parametric
   boundary has a special, tractable form, I think. *)

bdx[t_]:=Simplify[fromMaster[2*t-1,1]][[1]]

bdy[t_]:=Simplify[fromMaster[2*t-1,1]][[2]]

krnl[x_,y_]:=1;  (* for area, function is 1 *)

(* Ifun as defined here embodies many special cases, the parameter
   t must go from 0 to 1, there can only be one parametrized
   boundary, and it must be described by the global functions
   bdx[] and bdy[]. *)

Ifun[k_]:= Integrate[ Integrate[ k[bdx[t],y],{y,0,bdy[t]}]*bdx'[t],{t,0,1}]
