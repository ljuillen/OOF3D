3.1.2

Fixed errors that made saving a large Mesh in abaqus format take far
too long, and also moved the bulk of the code from Python to C++.

Fixed an error that made creating a large Skeleton take too long
because it was recalculating the homogeneity unnecessarily.

Fixed a race condition that caused problems when a Mesh was created
before its Skeleton had finished computing its homogeneity.

Fixed a bug in which the coordinate axes were drawn badly if a
Microstructure had an extreme aspect ratio.

Fixed a bug that made it impossible to save files after loading images
using the "Listed Files" option.

3.1.1.1

Minor changes to make the old gcc 4.7 compilers happy.

3.1.1

Much faster element homogeneity calculation by dividing the
Microstructure into subregions to limit the size of the graphs.

Fixed a possible infinite loop in the homogeneity calculation.

Fixed the abaqus output for Skeletons and Meshes.  It still needs to
be tested by a real abaqus user.

3.1.0

Fixed the filters for limiting display layers to particular voxel or
skeleton groups.  They now update properly when the underlying groups
are modified.

Fixed a bug in which voxels that had been removed from a voxel group
could be still considered part of the group.  The cross-referencing
had not been fully updated.

"Fix Illegal Elements" now does a better job with elements that have
nodes on external faces of the microstructure, and the status of fixed
Skeletons is correctly displayed in the GUI.

Fixed a bug that was causing the Skeleton homogeneity to be recomputed
after some Undo and Redo operations.

Fixed the behavior of the progress bars when automatically creating
voxel groups. They weren't able to interrupt long computations
effectively.

Added quadratic tetrahedral elements.

Implemented a new and vastly superior method for calculating element
homogeneity.  It's faster and more robust.

Fixed a bug involving cloning graphics windows with hidden display
layers.

Fixed a bug that prevented the analysis page from retrieving stored
analyses. 

The setup.py script now understands '~' in vtkdir arguments.

Fixed the "Copy All" command for copying solvers from one Mesh to another.

3.0.1

The interval parameter for output schedules now can't be set to zero,
and the delay can't be negative.

Fixed a bug in setup.py wrt --with-swig.

Fixed setup.py so that it understands "linux3".

If a mesh is saved while it's being solved, its saved status is stored
as "Unsolved" rather than "Solving".

Field initializers can now be copied.

Graphics windows are cleared properly when objects are deleted.

Fixed the bug that was causing the skeleton material display to be
incorrect sometimes.

Fixed the skeleton quality display.

Fixed an error in the calculation of the tetrahedron shape energy.
