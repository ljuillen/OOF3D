    For the clearer view, let us hide the Skeleton layer.
    Navigate to the bottom of the graphics window and find a layer
    labeled BOLD(Skeleton(skeleton)) and Uncheck the square box to
    hide the layer.

    Due to the shape of the domain, it is obvious that stresses are
    highly concentrated in the region surrounding the corner.
    It is also safe to assume that errors in this region would be higher

    Select BOLD(stress), which is the only entity,
    for the BOLD(flux) parameter.
    Set BOLD(threshold) to be BOLD(10).

    For each element, an L2 error norm will be computed
    with stresses computed from the finite element solution and their
    recovered counterparts, which act as exact stresses.
    If the relative error exceeds 10 percent, the element will be refined.

    The next three parameters, BOLD(criterion), BOLD(degree) and, BOLD(alpha)
    take care of actual refinement. Don't bother with these parameters
    for this tutorial (See BOLD(skeleton) tutorial for details).

    Sometimes, refinement could create badly-shaped elements. These elements
    can be removed by turning on the BOLD(rationalize) option.

    By default, field values are transferred to the refined mesh.
    This, however, is just a
    projection of the previous solution onto the refined mesh --
    you need to re-solve the problem for improved solution.
