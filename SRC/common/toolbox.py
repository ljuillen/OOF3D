# Toolboxes for the graphics window and its ghost.

# A Toolbox represents a set of operations that can be performed in a
# graphics window.  Only one toolbox is active at any time.  The
# non-graphical toolboxes derived from the Toolbox class perform the
# actions (to the extent that they make sense in a non-graphical
# environment).  They have graphical counterparts derived from
# common.IO.GUI.toolboxGUI.GfxToolbox.  When in graphics mode, the
# makeGUI function must be overloaded to return a GfxToolbox instance.

# Toolbox subclasses must have an 'ordering' attribute, which is used
# to determine their placement in the GUI.  Each subclass must make
# itself known at *import* time by calling
# registerToolboxClass(subclass, ordering).

# Toolbox subclasses must have 'tip' and 'discussion' strings, which
# will be inserted into the documentation page for the
# OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.<ToolboxName> menu.  The discussion can be an
# xmlmenudump.DiscussionFile object, if necessary.
