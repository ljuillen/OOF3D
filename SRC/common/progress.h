// Progress objects keep track of a task's progress toward its goal
// (DefiniteProgress subclass) or just that it's still active
// (IndefiniteProgress subclass).  They're created by
// ThreadState.getProgress() and deleted when the ThreadState is
// destroyed.  Progress objects are lightweight so that running
// processes don't have to do much work to maintain them, even inside
// inner loops.  UI elements that display progress (ProgressBars) can
// do more work because they're not called frequently.
