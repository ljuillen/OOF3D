## Routines for submitting functions to be run in a subthread.  A
## "subthread" is a thread that's not associated directly with a
## menuitem or worker, but may have been spawned by such a thread.
## When threads are enabled, a thread is launched executing the
## proposed function. If threads are not enabled, the function is
## simply called on the main thread.
