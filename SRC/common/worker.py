# Worker classes.  The basic highest-level interface is that workers
# must have a "start" routine, which is called from the menu item
# after the worker is created.

# Threading is handled with an extra layer of indirection -- the
# "ThreadedWorker" and subclasses are actually wrappers, which contain
# a "ThreadedWorkerCore" object.  These wrapper objects call their
# core object's "start" routine, and then manage the main thread,
# which may want to do complicated things before (or instead of)
# returning control to the caller.  The TextThreadedWorker draws the
# progress bar for the command.  The GUIThreadedWorkerBlock object,
# used in GUI mode, blocks until the just-launched thread terminates.
# This is useful when running scripts, for instance, when each script
# menu item (threadable or otherwise) runs on a subthread, but must
# not run concurrently with previous script commands.  This technique
# allows the GUI to be responsive and a script-reading progress bar to
# be presented during the read.

# Parallelization is fairly straightforward at this level -- menu
# items which are parallelized require a worker which is a subclass of
# ParallelWork, which itself only ensures that all the back-end
# machines receive the same menu item.

# Flag to indicate how to handle exceptions.  If False, workers should
# catch exceptions and send them to the reporter.  If True, workers
# should allow exceptions to propagate to the caller.  In the case of
# threaded workers, the core should propagate the exception data to
# the calling worker, which should re-raise it. propagate_exceptions
# is normally False. It's True in batch mode or when running without
# an interpreter (regression test mode).

# Worker is the the base class for the workers that are invoked by the
# menu items.  Subclasses either actually call the menu item's
# callback, or invoke a WorkerCore that calls the callback.  In the
# first case, the Worker and the WorkerCore may be the same object.

# Keep track of existing workers for debugging and testing.
