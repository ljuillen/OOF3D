## TODO OPT: Why do we need mainthread()?  It's not used very much.  Just
## call threadstate.mainthread_query() directly.

# Routines for submitting functions to be run in the main thread.

# When not in threaded graphics mode, both run() and runBlock() just
# execute the given function.  In threaded graphics mode, they execute
# the function on the main thread.  In that case, run() doesn't wait
# for an answer, so it can't return a value.  runBlock() does wait, so
# it does return a value.
