# This file is just a resting place for run-time parameters that are
# set in oof.py and used elsewhere.  It prevents the other files from
# having to import oof.py (which is not allowed because it leads to
# import loops) or having to define the parameters themselves.  The
# other files may not be natural places for those parameters to live.
