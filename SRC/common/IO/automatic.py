# AutomaticNames look just like strings, but when an object with an
# automatically generated name is redefined, its AutomaticName can be
# redefined too.  Code can use isisntance(name, AutomaticName) to
# distinguish AutomaticNames from plain strings.  The 'resolver'
# function of an AutomaticNameParameter should return an
# AutomaticName, if appropriate.  See OutputSchedule.replace() and
# scheduledoutputmenu.outputNameResolver() for examples.

class AutomaticName(str):
    # Here we redefine __repr__ to include 'AutomaticName', but don't
    # redefine __str__.  Doing it this way means that AutomaticNames
    # that appear in scripts are labelled as such, but they aren't
    # labelled in the GUI.
