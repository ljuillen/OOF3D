#####################################

## Display Object Overview

## TODO 3.1: Update these comments.

# Each layer in the graphics window is defined by a DisplayMethod
# instance.  (Subclasses of DisplayMethod are defined elsewhere.)  The
# source of the data for each DisplayMethod is a Who object.

# OBOLETE COMMENT: There can be many DisplayMethods for a single Who,
# and the user may want to change each DisplayMethod's Who at the same
# time, so DisplayMethods are grouped into LayerSets, and the Who is
# associated with the LayerSet instead of with the DisplayMethod
# directly.  Each DisplayMethod knows its LayerSet, and each LayerSet
# contains a list of its DisplayMethods.  The graphics window, or
# rather its non-gui component, the GhostGfxWindow, maintains a list
# of LayerSets.

# OBSOLETE COMMENT The Display is an object contained in a
# GhostGfxWindow that manages the DisplayLayers.  (It's not clear at
# this time why it's a separate class, and whether or not its
# functionality should be merged into the GhostGfxWindow class.  The
# separation may just be a historical artifact.  Resolving that is a
# TODO 3.1.)  The Display keeps a list of DisplayMethods, containing
# all the methods of all the LayerSets in the GhostGfxWindow.  The
# Display's list determines the order in which the layers are drawn.
# The LayerSets' lists have nothing to do with drawing order.

# OBSOLETE COMMENT Layers are added to a graphics window when the
# LayerEditor calls GhostGfxWindow.incorporateLayer with a new
# DisplayMethod as an argument.

# OBSOLETE COMMENT If the GhostGfxWindow has no currently selected
# layer, a clone of the new LayerSet is added to the Display.  If
# there is a currently selected layer, its LayerSet is replaced with a
# clone of the new LayerSet.

# DisplayMethods are things like ContourPlots, Bitmaps, etc --
# different ways of displaying different types of Who objects on the
# canvas.  They must have a 'draw' function, and the Registration for
# each DisplayMethod class must have a 'whoclasses' attribute which
# lists the names of the WhoClasses that the DisplayMethod accepts.
## TODO 3.1: Update this comment for vtk based CanvasLayers.

# TODO 3.1: Now that this has been pared down because there are no longer
# multiple devices, this is basically a wrapper for the
# OOF3DCanvasLayer. Should the relevant functions just be added to a
# .spy file?  NO -- the class structure would be too complicated:
# different C++ base classes for a single python RegisteredClass?

## TODO 3.1 LOCK: If a DisplayMethod ought to lock its Who source, it will
## have to run the pipeline up through the point where the source is
## read by calling Update() from the switchboard callback that
## indicated that the source had changed.  Then the switchboard
## callback and the lock can run on a subthread, and the final call to
## Render() can run on the main thread without having to access the
## Who object.

## TODO 3.1: DisplayMethod instances should keep all their switchboard
## signals in a list stored in the base class, so that they can all be
## removed together by the base class destroy() method.  Since some
## DisplayMethods use multiple inheritance, it's hard to ensure that
## all the subclass correct destroy() methods are called. (Maybe we
## should just use super()?)
