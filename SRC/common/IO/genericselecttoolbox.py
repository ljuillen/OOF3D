# Each way of selecting pixels is described by a SelectionMethod
# subclass.  SelectionMethod is a RegisteredClass.  The
# PixelSelectToolbox builds an OOFMenu with a menu item for each
# subclass.  The arguments to the menu item are the parameters for the
# SelectionMethod plus a list of Points.  Invoking the menu item
# creates an instance of the method and calls its select() function on
# the list of points.

# Each Registration for a SelectionMethod subclass needs to have an
# 'events' attribute, which consists of a list of strings indicating
# which mouse events it requires.  Allowed events are 'down', 'move',
# and 'up'.  

# The GUI version of the toolbox contains a RegisteredClassFactory for
# the SelectionMethods.  It installs itself as the graphics window's
# MouseHandler.  When it gets a 'down' mouse event, it starts storing
# the events' positions.  When it gets an 'up' event, it checks the
# 'events' setting for current SelectionMethod in the factory,
# constructs an OOFMenu argument list with the method's parameters,
# and invokes the non-GUI menu item, which creates the actual method
# does the selection.

# Base class for selection toolboxes.

# Child classes should implement the "signal" method, which
# notifies whoever needs to be notified when a new selection
# is available.
#
# Selections are made to Selection objects that live inside some
# source object.  For example, the pixel selection lives inside a
# Microstructure.  Child classes must provide a "sourceParams" method,
# which returns a list of Parameter objects that will be used to
# locate the source, and a "getSourceObject" method which, given the
# parameters, returns the Who object corresponding to the source.  See
# PixelSelectToolbox in pixelselect.py for an example.

# "name" is the menu tree entry, as well as the string that will
# appear on the notebook tab in the GUI window.  "method" is the base
# of a registered class hierarchy of selection operations.
## TODO: "method" is a stupid name for it.
