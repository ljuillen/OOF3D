# The Historian class is used by GUI code to record and revisit
# previously executed commands (or other historical objects, but we'll
# call them 'commands' here).  It does not actually contain any GUI
# code itself, but it provides callbacks to be installed in GUI
# objects.

# Outside the Historian, the GUI must have a way of displaying
# commands and choosing between them, eg, with a
# RegisteredClassFactory.  The widget that does this must have a
# callback function called when its state is changed.  That callback
# must call (or be) Historian.stateChangeCB.  The GUI must also have
# 'Next' and 'Prev' buttons (or the equivalent) used to move through
# the historical commands, and the callbacks for those buttons must
# call (or be) Historian.nextCB and Historian.prevCB.

# The constructor takes some callbacks as arguments.  Only the first
# is required:
#
#  setCB is called when a historical object should be displayed.  The
#  object to be displayed is its first argument.  setCBkwargs, if any,
#  are passed to it as well.  (If setCB is a RegisteredClassFactory's
#  set() function, then setCBkwargs should be {'interactive':1}.
#
#  sensitizeCB (optional) is called when something has happened to
#  change the availability of the Next and Prev operations.  It should
#  call a function that uses Historian.nextSensitive() and
#  Historian.prevSensitive() to sensitize or desensitize the Next and
#  Prev buttons.
#
#  compareCB is called to determine if an object being stored matches
#  the previously stored object.  If compareCB returns True, the new
#  object is not stored.  The arguments to compareCB are the two
#  objects being compared.  If compareCB is None (the default value),
#  no comparison is done and new objects are always stored.

# Historian.record() must be used to put new objects in the history.
# These are the same objects that will be passed to setCB() later.

# Historian.__len__() returns the number of objects stored, and
# Historian.current() returns the current object, if the history is
# being edited, and None otherwise.

# History entries can be invalidated, eg. if I've selected the members
# of a group, but the group is later deleted, then going "previous" to
# that entry will result in an invalid display.  (This isn't really
# the historian's problem, though.  The widget displaying the
# operation should be able to display something sensible, or know that
# it's in an invalid state if it can't.)
