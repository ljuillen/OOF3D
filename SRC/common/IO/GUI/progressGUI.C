// The code in this file allows a C++ Progress object to disconnect
// from its Python/gtk GUIProgressBar safely.  This is done when a
// subthread calls Progress.finish().  Progress.finish() is
// necessarily called on a subthread, but the gtk calls in
// GUIProgressBar.disconnect() have to be performed on the main
// thread.  The old way of doing this was for Progress.finish() to
// call a Python function (A) which called another Python function (B)
// on the main thread.  The trouble with that was that after B
// finished, the GUIProgressBar had no references, and was garbage
// collected in A.  Since the GUIProgressBar has gtk components and A
// was running on the subthread, gtk calls were made on the subthread
// during garbage collection, leading to X11 synchronization errors.
// The code here provides a way for the C++ Progress object on the
// subthread to call B on the main thread directly, without an
// intervening subthread Python function.  That ensures (?) that the
// destruction of the GUIProgressBar's gtk widgets doesn't occur on
// the subthread.

// Because the Progress object is in common, it can't make any gtk
// calls directly.  Instead, the Progress class has a callback hook
// which is set by the initialize() function in this file (which is
// called by the GUI initialization code).  The callback function
// (disconnectPBar(), below) installs idleCallback() as an idle
// callback in the gtk main loop, then blocks and waits for
// pyDisconnect() to finish.
