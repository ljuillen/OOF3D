# The function 'questioner' brings up a dialog box containing a
# question and a bunch of buttons corresponding to the possible
# answers.  The answer clicked on is returned.  The arguments are the
# question, followed by the answers.  An optional keyword argument,
# 'default', specifies which answer has the focus when the dialog is
# brought up.  If the value of the default argument isn't in the list
# of answers, it is *prepended* to the list.

# Ugly code here...  We want questions posed with the questioner to be
# completely independent of the GUI, since there's a non-GUI API for
# it.  But in GUI mode it would be nice to have pretty icons on the
# questioner's answer buttons.  The _stock dictionary here maps
# answers to gtk stock icons.  More than one answer string can be
# mapped to the same stock icon.  The stock label won't be used --
# just the icon.  This code is ugly because answers that don't appear
# in this dictionary won't have icons on their buttons -- this file
# has to anticipate questions that will be asked elsewhere.

# A solution will be to write a stock filter who find the appropriate
# stock_id based on the answer to display. The second solution case is
# to know the stock_id. So the developer pass the stock_id and
# response at the same time. So we will have:

# reporter.query("Delete skeleton %s?" % skelname, OK", "Cancel",
# default="OK") becomes:
# reporter.query("Delete skeleton %s?" % skelname,
# {"choice":"OK","stock":gtk.STOCK_OK},
# {"choice":"Cancel","stock":gtk.STOCK_CANCEL},
# default={"answer":"OK","icon":gtk.STOCK_OK})

# There are 90 gtk 2.20 stock ids.  With the second option we could
# get rid of the answer icon guessing part meaning _stock removed
#
