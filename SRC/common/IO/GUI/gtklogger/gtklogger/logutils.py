# file clean.

# This file also contains some global variables and access functions
# for them (so they're not really global variables...).  This helps to
# avoid import loops, because this files doesn't import anything else.

## log_motion_events() and dont_log_motion_events() control whether or
## not motion-notify-events will be logged.  If called with a widget
## argument, logging will be turned on or off for the specified widget
## and its children.  If the argument is omitted or None, logging will
## be turned on or off for all widgets, even those which had been the
## arguments of earlier calls to the functions.

## (The argument doesn't actually have to be a gtk.Widget -- if a
## Logger has been created for some other type of object, it can use
## this machinery as well. If the object has a get_parent() method
## then turning logging on or off for an object will apply to its
## children.  If there's no get_parent() method, the logging state
## only applies to the specified object.

## suppress_motion_events(widget) returns a boolean, specifying
## whether or not motion events should be suppressed (not logged) for
## the given widget.  If the argument is omitted or None, it returns
## the default value which applies to all widgets that have *not* been
## the argument of log_motion_events() or dont_log_motion_events().
## suppress_motion_events() should only be used inside Loggers.
