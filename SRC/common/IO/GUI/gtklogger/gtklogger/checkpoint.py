## Checkpointing.  When recording, calling "checkpoint(<comment>)"
## increments the counter and writes "checkpoint <comment>" in the log
## file.  When replaying, a "checkpoint <comment>" line in the log
## file won't finish until the same checkpoint is reached by the
## executing code.  There is no constraint on the order in which
## checkpoints are reached when running in threaded mode.
