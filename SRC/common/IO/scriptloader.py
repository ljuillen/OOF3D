# ScriptLoader is a derived class of InteractiveInterpreter that
# provides a correct traceback when exceptions occur while processing
# a Python file.  In addition, it provides a hook that can be
# redefined in a derived class to update a progress bar.

# The problem with InteractiveInterpreter is that when an exception is
# raised, the line numbers in the traceback are offsets into the
# current code block, and the current code block is not the file being
# processed.  It is instead just the set of lines passed to runsource
# since the last successful execution.  The traceback uses these
# erroneous line numbers to find the source code for the offending
# instructions.  The filename passed to runsource is only used in
# error messages and to find the source code.  The solution presented
# here is to pass a fake filename to runsource.  The fake name encodes
# the line number of the beginning of the code block.  Then when an
# exception occurs, the actual line numbers can be computed, and the
# traceback can be corrected.

# Because it's difficult to actually create and modify a traceback
# object, this code only creates a modified traceback list, as
# returned by traceback.extract_tb.  That means that the modified
# traceback can't be passed to sys.excepthook.  Instead we pass the
# traceback list to excepthook.displayTraceBack().

# Another problem with InteractiveInterpreter is that it doesn't work
# the way execfile() does -- it requires a blank line at the end of an
# indented block, unless the next line is an "else", "elif", or
# "except".  So here we use InteractiveInterpreter to process blocks
# of code, but use the compiler module to find those blocks.  That way
# we're guaranteed that we won't separate an "if" from its "else".
# This is somewhat of a hack, and it fails in some perverse cases.  In
# particular, it won't work if multiline statements are concatenated
# by a semi-colon, like this:
#   f(
#   ); g(
#   )
# This case is sufficiently perverse that we won't worry about it.
