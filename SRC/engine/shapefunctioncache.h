// Store the values of the derivatives of a shapefunction and the
// determinant of the jacobian at gauss points. This differs from the
// precomputed values stored in the ShapeFunctionTable class, because
// those values only depend on the master element geometry. These
// values depend on the real space geometry.  We don't want to
// precompute and store the shapefunctions for each element
// individually, because that would take too much memory. But we don't
// want to recompute shape functions when computing all the different
// Properties of a single element.
