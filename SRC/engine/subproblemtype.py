# SubProblemType subclasses describe CSubProblem subclass
# instances. Using SubProblem or CSubProblem instances as parameter
# values in OOF.Subproblem.New is a memory leak, because the parameter
# keeps a copy of its value.  Since SubProblems are large objects, and
# tied to their Meshes, that's a bad idea.  SubProblemType is
# lightweight and not tied to a particular Mesh, so it's ok to have an
# extra one live inside the parameter object.
