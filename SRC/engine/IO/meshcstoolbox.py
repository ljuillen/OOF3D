# A toolbox for selecting cross-section paths in the graphics window.
# Should be able to create and remove paths, name them, and take a
# path and output data for the topmost contourable layer of the
# graphics window.

# add a path to a mesh, delete a path from a mesh, and actually draw
# the current topmost contourable output on the path.  The topmost
# contourable output implies a particular mesh.  Could also maintain a
# notion of a current path.
