// This file should be %include'd in all .swg files for properties
// derived directly from the Property base class.

// If we didn't have a complicated directory and module/package
// structure, we could simply use '%import "engine/properties.swg"'
// here.  But that inserts the line "from properties import *" in the
// swig-generated .py files in the property subdirectories, which is
// not what we want.  For one thing, it imports too much.  For
// another, it doesn't get the correct path to the properties.py file.
// So we use the less powerful '%extern' construction, and explicitly
// add the code to import the name we need for the Property base
// class.
