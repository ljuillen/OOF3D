# A Selection object contains a RingBuffer of SelectionSets.  Undoing
# and redoing the selection changes the state of the RingBuffer and
# causes the newly current SelectionSet to be written into the
# SkeletonContext's stack of Skeletons (which is also a RingBuffer).
# A SelectionSet contains a dictionary of SelectionTrackers, one entry
# for each CSkeleton in the SkeletonContext's undo buffer.

# SelectionSet objects occupy the undo/redo stack of the various
# Selection objects.  Each SelectionSet contains a WeakKeyDictionary
# of SelectionTrackers, keyed by the Skeleton to which the tracker
# belongs.  The dictionary is weak so that the trackers go away when
# the Skeleton is destroyed.

# The base class doesn't contain any references to selection, so that
# the machinery can be used for pinned nodes and other such skeleton
# component attributes.  See SelectionSet (below) for the functions
# that a derived class must provide.
