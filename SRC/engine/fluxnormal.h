// The fluxnormal classes are used by flux boundary conditions
// to evaluate the force density while integrating along a 
// boundary.  These are the classes that contain the return value.
//
// The reason for having classes set up this way is because we
// want to keep the relationship between fluxes and equations as
// loose and generic as possible -- in principle, a flux of any
// dimension could couple in surprising ways to equations of
// any number of components, and it's the job of the equation to
// figure this out and get it right.  For the base set of equations,
// this is a trivial process, and so the structure provided here
// is quite lightweight, but it provides room for expansion.

// The fluxnormal class also has the "transform" capability -- this
// takes a new "x" axis as an argument, and changes the internal x and
// y values such that the new x and y values are the lab-frame values
// of the old x and y values, which are the values in a frame where
// the outward normal is the +x axis and the tangent direction is the
// +y axis.  The definition of "outward" is such that this is a
// right-handed system.  
//   For instance, if a vector is given by the user as (0.1, 0.0)
// in the boundary-normal coordinates, and the boundary normal direction
// is 30 degrees up from the lab x-axis, i.e. (0.866, 0.500), then
// the appropriate lab-frame value of this vector is (0.087, 0.050),
// i.e. it is of length 0.1 in the normal direction.
