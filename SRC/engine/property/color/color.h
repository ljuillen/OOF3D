// Color is slightly more general than just a gray value -- for now,
// it can be initialized to either (r,g,b), or to a gray level,
// all of which are assumed to be between 0.0 and 1.0.
//   Since virtually all of the graphics is done in Python, this
// class functions primarily as a place-holder, allowing materials
// to have color properties.  Before any graphics color assignments
// are contemplated, this color should be converted to the
// appropriate GUI color object, thereby preventing a lot of
// color callbacks through SWIG.
