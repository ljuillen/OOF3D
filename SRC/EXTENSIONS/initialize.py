# If you want to explicitly load extensions every time OOF2 runs, then
# import their python modules here.  Be aware that this file will be
# overwritten when a new version of OOF2 is installed, so your edits
# will be lost.

# If you want all modules in the EXTENSIONS directory (this directory)
# to be loaded when OOF2 starts, then start OOF2 with the --autoload
# command line option.  You *don't* have to explicitly import
# extension modules if you use --autoload, but you *do* have to
# arrange for them to be built (by putting them in DIR.py in this
# directory, or by building them elsewhere and installing them in this
# directory).

## <Put your own import lines here>


##### 

# This loads all modules if --autoload has been specified.
