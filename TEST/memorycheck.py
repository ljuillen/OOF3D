# Define a decorator so that all test methods check that
# Microstructure, Skeleton, and Mesh objects are deallocated properly,
# and that all Workers are destroyed.  These tests have to be done
# after the Microstructure is deleted, but they can't be put in the
# tearDown method because UnitTest.assertXXXX doesn't work there.  The
# tearDown operations are done here, instead.
