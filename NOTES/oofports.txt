Notes on creating a separate MacPorts installation for building a
binary distribution of OOF3D

sudo mkdir /opt/oofports

# Clear PATH:
export PATH=/opt/oofports/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin

---
Build MacPorts

# Download latest MacPorts and rename the top directory to OOFPorts
cd OOFPorts
./configure --prefix=/opt/oofports --with-applications-dir=/opt/oofports/Applications --without-startupitems
make
sudo make install
sudo port selfupdate

---
Add oof3d and vtk8 ports

# Edit /opt/oofports/etc/macports/sources.conf to insert
#   file:///Users/langer/ports
# before the rsync://rsync.macports.org line

# Edit /opt/oofports/etc/macports/variants.conf to add the line
#   -x11 +no_x11 +quartz
# at the end

mkdir -p ~/ports/graphics/vtk8/files
# Put the vtk8 Portfile in ~/ports/graphics/vtk8 and the
# patch-antialias.diff in ~/ports/graphics/vtk8/files.

mkdir -p ~/ports/science/oof3d
# Put the oof3d Portfile there.

# Until the glib2 bug is fixed... We need to build glib2 as if it's
# using the +x11 variant.  port mpkg will always use the +quartz
# variant, so we need to hack the Portfile to make the +quartz variant
# the same as the +x11 variant.
mkdir -p ~/ports/devel/glib2/files
cp $(port file glib2) ~/ports/devel/glib2
cp $(port dir glib2)/files/* ~/ports/devel/glib2/files
# Edit ~/ports/devel/glib2/Portfile to change
# "--with-appinfo-impl=native" to "--with-appinfo-impl=generic" in the
# "variant quartz" block.

cd ~/ports
sudo portindex

# Set the version line in ~/ports/science/oof3d/Portfile. 

# Put the oof3d tar file in either localhost/~langer/oof/oof3d/source
# or www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof/oof3d/source, and set the master_sites
# line in the Portfile accordingly.  The tar file must be named
# oof3d-${version}.tar.gz, where ${version} is the version string from
# the version line in the Portfile.

sudo port selfupate
#sudo port install glib2 +x11 -quartz
sudo port install oof3d


---------------

To build a binary distribution:

Make sure that the current version is pushed to github.

Run ./make_dist.

Either put the .tar.gz file on the CTCMS server or on a local web
server.  Adjust the master_sites line in the oof3d Portfile
accordingly.

cd ~/stow
./switchto oof2-none
./switchto3d oof3d-none

sudo use-ports none

In a window in which PYTHONPATH is unset
 export PATH=/opt/oofports/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
 sudo port uninstall oof3d
 sudo port clean --all oof3d
 sudo port install oof3d
 sudo port mpkg oof3d
 sudo cp \
 /opt/oofports/var/macports/build/_Users_langer_ports_science_oof3d/oof3d/work/oof3d-3.1.99.mpkg
 ~/Desktop


----------------

To install and test the binary distribution

The binary distribution installs into /opt/oofports, so the
/opt/oofports in which the distribution was built has to be moved away:

sudo mv /opt/oofports /opt/oofports-build

Unpack the binary distribution by double clicking on the mpkg file.
Unset PYTHONPATH.
export PATH=/opt/oofports/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

Run /opt/oofports/bin/oof3d or /opt/oofports/bin/oof3dtest

--------------------------

${destroot} =
/opt/oofports/var/macports/build/_Users_langer_ports_science_oof3d/oof3d/work/destroot


${destroot}${prefix} =
/opt/oofports/var/macports/build/_Users_langer_ports_science_oof3d/oof3d/work/destroot/opt/oofports 


For a macports build, final installation prefix should be sys.prefix.
"python setup.py install" should put files into ${destroot}${prefix}
but should use sys.prefix in install_name_tool.

For a non-macports build, final installation prefix should be set from
--prefix, which should also be used in install_name_tool.


Don't use DESTDIR when setting --prefix.
Always set install_name using --prefix only.
Only when moving files, move them to DESTDIR/prefix.
