There's something wrong with the canvas, that causes it to print these
warnings:

> *** attempt to put segment in horiz list twice

  The warnings typically occur when drawing skeletons or meshes on the
canvas, for microstructures which are approximately one physical unit
in size, and when the element size is around 1/12 of a unit, and 
the elements are not drawn in raster order.

  The message itself comes from the libart rendering library, and 
apparently has something to do with intersection checking or 
self-intersection checking.  The code where the message originates
has comments indicating that what has happened is that some kind of 
basic sanity check has failed, the list of segments to be drawn is
apparently corrupted, and the current segment will be skipped.

  As far as can be determined, nothing is drawn incorrectly when
this message occurs.

  This *may* be an example of gnome bug 316583,
<http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=316583>, which is also
marked as a duplicate of gnome bug 317136 
<http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=317136>, which is about
rendering problems with libart and the gnome canvas.  

  A comment from Alexander Larsson regarding gnome bug 317136 
suggests that it will probably not be fixed, since libart is not
being maintained, and "the future of antialiased rendering lies
with Cairo".

 
  HOWEVER:

  Attempts to replicate the bug behavior using an isolated test
canvas have not been successful.  This leaves open the possibility
that the bug actually lies in the OOF code.

  To attempt to reproduce it, all the calls made to the OOFCanvas 
in the bug scenario were recorded, and "played back" to an OOFCanvas
object which was running standalone outside of OOF.  The standalone
canvas did not exhibit the bug behavior.
  
  The bug may be related to the scroll-window context of the 
embedded OOFCanvas, or to some other interaction of the canvas with
its gtk environment.  

  The bug occurs in both threaded and unthreaded mode, and with both
a buffered and unbuffered canvas.

  It is of course possible that the attempt to reproduce the bug was
incomplete in some way.

  To reproduce the bug, do the following:
  - Start OOF with no arguments.
  - Create a 1x1 microstructure, with pixel size 10x10, with no image.
  - Create a 4x4 quad element skeleton
  - Unconditionally trisect all elements of the skeleton.
  - Open a graphics window.

  You will see many (about 40) occurrences of the "attempt to put 
segment in horiz list twice" message.  

  Note that the bug does not occur if you directly create and draw
a 12x12 skeleton on the 1x1 microstructure -- it apparently is 
related to the order in which the skeleton's polygons are drawn.

  A work-around to avoid the messages is apparently to ensure that
one is always working with a large enough microstructure.
