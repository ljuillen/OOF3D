Things the GUI must be able to do. Items in this list do not
necessarily correspond to particular interface widgets.


Physics:
    List Fields and Equations automatically.
    Define and Activate Fields.
    Activate Equations.
    Initialize Fields.
    Set in-plane flags for Fields and Fluxes.

Materials:
  Properties:
    List all Property classes, and all parametrized named instances.
    Create a parametrized instance from a Property class.
    Copy a parametrized instance.
    Name a parametrized instance.
    Edit the parameters of an instance.
    Delete a parametrized instance.
  Parameters:
    Set values graphically, where possible.
    Allow keyboard input whenever GUI input is not precise.
    Display values concisely, without requiring a pop up window.
    Editable 2D graph to set non-linear properties (eg modulus as fn of strain).
    Read non-linear parameter data from a file. 
  Materials:
    Create a named Material.
    Add a parametrized Property to a Material via a Link or a
      Copy.  (A Link doesn't give the Material its own Property
      instance, so editing the instance can affect more than one
      Material.)
    Remove Property instances from a Material.
  Load Materials and Properties from a file.
  Indicate badly formed Materials (redundant and/or missing properties)


Mesh Generation:
   Read Mesh from a file.
   Read GhostMesh from a file.  (GhostMesh specifies geometry and
     materials, not element type.)
   Create rectangular GhostMesh.
   Define Element Groups.
   Select/unselect Elements via GUI or ElementGroup.
   Assign Materials to selected Elements of Mesh or GhostMesh.
   Convert GhostMesh to Mesh by assigning Element type.
   Add Line Elements at interfaces.
   Split Nodes at cracks.

Element and Node Groups:
   Create group.
   Delete group.
   Add selected Element/Node to group.
   Remove selected Element/Node from group.
   Boolean operations on groups.

Boundary Conditions:
   Define and name Boundaries.
   Undefine Boundaries.
   Define Boundary Conditions.
       Fixed Field component.
       Fixed normal component of Flux.
       Linear combination of the above.
       All can be specified as functions of position or other Fields.
   Remove Boundary Conditions from Boundaries.
   Delete Boundary Condition definitions.

Solution:
   Choose solution method, preconditioner.
       Linear
       Non-Linear
   Set tolerance, max iterations.
   Solve.
   Adaptive refinement controls.
   Thread control.
     Solve in this thread.
     Create new thread.
       Local or Remote?
   Stop button.

Graphical Output:
   2D Plot of specified function on the Mesh.
      Different ways of positioning the Elements:  (WHERE)
	  At undisplaced positions.

	  With displacements determined by arbitrary user-specified
	    function of Fields, Fluxes, and position.

	 Element edges.
	 Element interior.
	 Nodes.
	 Boundaries.
      Set function to plot:  (WHAT)
	 Predefined functions.
	    Components, Magnitudes, Invariants of Fields and Fluxes.
	    Material color.
	    Other natural quantities, eg, Elastic Energy.
	 Arbitrary functions of position, Fields, and Fluxes.
	 Functions of Elements, not of position.
	    Mutation state  (when, how, why...).
	    Intrinsic color.
	    Adaptive refinement error estimator.
	 Restrict output to Elements with a given Material or in a given
	    Group.

      Superimpose outputs.
	 Define layering order.
	 Change layering order.
	 Hide/show layer.
      Cross Section.
	 Draw a line on the output window and plot function value
            along the line.
      Time should be displayed somewhere, when relevant.
      Display (and print) color scale with labels.
      Set Color map.
      Set range of values to be shown.
      Set update time: (WHEN)
         Never
         After equilibration
         During equilibration (every x iterations).
      Stop button.
