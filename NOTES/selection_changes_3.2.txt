Changes to the selection commands from version 3.1.2 to 3.2.

The OOF.PixelSelection menu is now OOF.VoxelSelection.

Menu commands that used to be in OOF.Graphics_XXX.Toolbox.Pixel_Select
are now in OOF.VoxelSelection.  The selection menu commands no longer
are dependent on the view parameters in whichever graphics window
they're started from.

Except for Undo, Redo, Clear, and Invert,
selection methods that used to be subcommands in the menu are now all
done with the Select subcommand, which takes a 'method' argument.

Most methods take an 'operator' argument, which can take the values
Select(), AddSelection(), Unselect(), Toggle(), and Intersect().
Some methods used operators previously.  The old SelectOnly() is now
Select().  The old Select() is now AddSelection().

The argument for OOF.VoxelSelection.Clear, Invert, Undo, Redo is
'microstructure'.  When invoked from a graphics toolbox the command
used to be OOF.Graphics_XXX.Pixel_Select.Clear(source=<image name>).

When selecting elements by homogeneity or shape energy, both min and
max thresholds can now be set.
