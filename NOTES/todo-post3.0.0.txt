This list is a summary of TODOs in the OOF3D code as of the release of
3.0.0.  It doesn't list every TODO individually.  Some topics, mainly
parallelization, adaptive mesh refinement, interfaces, plasticity, and
merging 2D into 3D have many TODOs in the code but are represented by
just a few items in this list.  TODOs referring to documentation or
that are only relevant to 2D are not included.
