# This is the start-up script for oof2.  It is installed as an
# executable file in the bin directory, *not* the python library.
# "import oof2" statements refer to the oof2 module in the library,
# not to this file.

import sys
import os

# need to set path so that it imports the oof package that we want
import oof2
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(oof2.__file__))

# All user input is evaluated in this environment, so first import
# useful things like the math library.
from math import *

# The real start-up code is in ooflib.common.oof.  Until it is loaded,
# no modules containing oof C++ code can be used.  Therefore, don't
# even try loading any other oof code (not even the debug module)
# before here!

from ooflib.common import oof
oof.run()
