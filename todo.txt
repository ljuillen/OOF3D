TODO LIST FOR OOF3D

Before Next Release
-------------------

Higher order elements.

Optimize categoryVolumes.

Merge branches
  Ryan's 3D widgets  (Needs to be finished for voxel selection)
  Yannick's mouse buttons for rotate, zoom, etc.  (Needs to be finished?)
  Lizhong's solvers.

Use tcmalloc (already in Lizhong's branch?)

Fix Basic Tutorial -- don't use "Group" on the jpeg image, it takes
too long and uses up way too much memory if users don't hit "Stop"
soon enough.


Soon
----

Reduce memory use by optionally using chars instead of ints for the
voxel category: CMicrostructure::categorymap is Array<char>.   Can
images be stored with fewer bytes?

Profile VSB construction on a large image with complicated category
structures.  Does it need to be optimized?  See TODO in
CMicrostructure::categorize() wrt not creating the full array of
ProtoVSBNodes.


At Some Later Time
------------------

Upgrade VTK

Parallelize categoryVolumes.

Migrate to Python 3.x

Convert pixel category array to octree, and construct voxel set
boundaries from the octree, or compute element homogeneity from octree
elements instead of voxels.  Maybe.

Move swig output to the build directory, and remove SRC/SWIG3D).  The
way it is now, building dist3d after building debug3d fails, because
the swig output files contain code generated from #ifdef DEBUG blocks,
but those output files are in SRC/SWIG3D and aren't rebuilt when the
build options are changed.  Do this in 2D too.
