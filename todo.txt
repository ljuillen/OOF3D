TODO LIST FOR OOF3D

Before Next Release
-------------------

Higher order elements.

Optimize categoryVolumes.

Merge branches
  Ryan's 3D widgets  (Needs to be finished for voxel selection)
  Yannick's mouse buttons for rotate, zoom, etc.  (Needs to be finished?)
  Lizhong's solvers.

Use tcmalloc (already in Lizhong's branch?)

Fix Basic Tutorial -- don't use "Group" on the jpeg image, it takes
too long and uses up way too much memory if users don't hit "Stop"
soon enough.


At Some Later Time
------------------

Upgrade VTK

Parallelize categoryVolumes.
