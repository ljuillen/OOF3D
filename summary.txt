Code in common/IO is for things that have to be present even if the
GUI is not running.  Anything that actually interacts with the GUI
windows and widgets is in common/IO/GUI.

Since session logs can be recorded with the GUI and replayed without
it, many classes are split between common/IO and common/IO/GUI.  A
base class in common/IO will define methods that are redefined in
common/IO/GUI.  The class in common/IO will store data and manipulate
it via menu commands, and the related class in common/IO/GUI will
display the data graphically and execute menu commands interactively.

The vtk objects are actually created even when the GUI is not running,
so they're in common/IO.

--------------

common/IO/GUI/gfxwindow3D.py
  GfxWindow3D is the class for the graphics window.
  GfxWindow3D.mouseHandler is set to an instance of a MouseHandler
  subclass, which controls how mouse clicks are handled.

common/IO/GUI/gfxwindowbase.py
  Base class for GfxWindow3D.
  GUI versions of menu callbacks from ghostgfxwindow.py.

common/IO/ghostgfxwindow.py
  Non-gui back end for gfxwindow.
  Stores and manages vtk layers.
  Defines general gfx window menu items.

common/IO/display.py
  DisplayMethod base class.  Each graphics layer is a DisplayMethod of
  some sort.  DisplayMethod is a high level python representation --
  what the user interacts with..

common/IO/clipplaneclickanddragdisplay.py
  DisplayMethod subclass that draws the clipping plane widget.

common/IO/voxelregionselectiondisplay.py
  Analog of clipplaneclickanddragmousehandler.py for selecting
  rectangular regions of voxel.
  
common/IO/canvaslayers.*
  The low level C++ code for graphics layers.  Most of the vtk calls
  are here.  The clipping widget is drawn by the PlaneAndArrowLayer.

common/IO/GUI/mousehandler.py
  Base class for mousehandlers.  There's not much in it.

common/IO/GUI/oofcanvas3D.*
  OOFCanvas3D is the class for the drawing area in the graphics
  window.  It generates the events handled by the mousehandler.
  
common/IO/GUI/viewertoolbox3dGUI.py
  ClipPlaneClickAndDragMouseHandler is the MouseHandler subclass that
  controls the clipping widget.

common/IO/viewertoolbox.py
  Menu items for 3D view manipulation.

common/IO/view.*
  Defines the View object which stores the clipping planes, camera
  position, etc.


----------------

General Infrastructure 

common/IO/oofmenu.py
common/IO/parameter.py
  Classes for menu items and parameters.

common/switchboard.*
   Message passing between modules.
